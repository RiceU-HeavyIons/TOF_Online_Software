Description: TODO file for Anaconda 2 development. I think this is in YAML format.
Entry:

  2008-12-01:
  - disable tdig, tdc and serdes if parent is disabled
  - turn on / off in-time sync
  - temperature threshold for every thub, tcpu and tdig
  - eclipse like intialize indicator
  - toggle debug by console command

  2008-11-30:
  - unit tests
  - (X) some tcpus are inactive with non-zero tray_id.
  - console command line history
  - (X) QDesktopServices::openUrl to ut tray page
  - environmental resources like url template in db or dot.rc?

  2008-11-29:
  - log facility db? console dialog
  - pc compatible console
  - (X) console extension: SHOW 2.2.8.255, RESET 2.2.10.0 etc.
  - console extension: hardware address version
  - console extension: password lock
  - address validator espeially AnRoot::find
  - add List<X> AnRoot::find(AnAddress) returns empty list if address is not valid
  - (X) think about THUB <=> TCPU relation. Parent <-> children relation is better? And assign logical address like THUB(1.0.0.0), TCPU(1.x.0.0). This hierarchy reminds me reset-order. Now question is numbering of x for TCPU: x=1-120 or x=1-30? => with this scheme, tcpu and serdes come to same level.
  - fix AnRoot::expand bug for Serdes address. last 255 has to be zero.
  - (X) console: read / write
  - implement THUB dump
  - implement Serdes dump
  - implement TDC dump
  - console extension: loading config set
  - window menu
  - file menu for Linux

  2008-11-28:
  - asynchronous (non-blocking) configuration
  - modal/modeless progress dialog
  - total progress in status bar
  - device / network name propergation
  - thub reset order (master -> slave)?
  - (X) tray_id or tray_sn display
  - serdes port <-> tray mapping awareness
  - font/stylesheet, session manager

  2008-11-27:
  - selected actions, and un-select mechanism
  - making test framework (read, read+write, etc.)
  - asynchronous (non-blocking) synchronization -- need to disable command actions and block synchronization when you push item on main table. also need to update the main model and view after finishing synchronization. maybe not full reset() but partially updating for each item.

  2008-11-26:
  - (X) Tray SN (tray_id) lookup
  - Real sort functionality
  - (X) Input Lijuan's map

  2008-11-25:
  - TDIG threshold writing after reset
  - TDC mask readout from database
  - TDC mask display
  - Think about activeness: what does it mean actually? (dis)connected, enabled/disabled, responding...
  - Don't get Firmware IDs and Chip IDs every time because they don't change much. -- put them in deep level?
  - TCPU PLD register 02, set value and read value.
  - TDIG, TCPU chip id verification. Again, set value and read value consistency

  2008-11-24:
  - (X) TDIG threshold display
  - (X) TDIG threshold readout from database
  - (X) TDIG chip id display
  - (X) TCPU mode display
  - (X) TCPU chip id display
  - (X) TCPU mode readout from database 
  - (X) SERDES port status display
  - (X) TCPU status to specify icon
  - (X) THUB status to specify icon
  - (X) TDIG status to specify icon
  - (X) SERDES status to specify icon
  - (X) Input default configuration set
  - (X) Parallel configuration implementation
  - (X) Parallel reset implementation
  - (X) Parallel synchronization implementation
  - (X) Progress message for Sync, Reset, Configuration
  - Reduce sync process by introducing last updated time-stamp and minimal interval
  - Automatic sync process
  - Robust PCAN error handling
  - Simplify message send / receive handling
  - TDC data handling with QSocketNotifier
  - Greeting message handling with QSocketNotifier
  - Icons for Rest and Configuration
