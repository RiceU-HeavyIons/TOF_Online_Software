  - (X) think about THUB <=> TCPU relation. Parent <-> children relation is better? And assign logical address like THUB(1.0.0.0), TCPU(1.x.0.0). This hierarchy reminds me reset-order. Now question is numbering of x for TCPU: x=1-120 or x=1-30? => with this scheme, tcpu and serdes come to same level.

  2008-11-27:
  - (X) selected actions, and un-select mechanism
  - making test framework (read, read+write, etc.)
  - asynchronous (non-blocking) synchronization -- need to disable command actions and block synchronization when you push item on main table. also need to update the main model and view after finishing synchronization. maybe not full reset() but partially updating for each item.

  - (X) TCPU PLD register 02, set value and read value.
