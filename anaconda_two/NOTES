With default non-expert mode, you only can refresh and issue user command 3. 
If you want to use expert mode again, you just need to open console from view menu 
and type 'expert 1'. 
Typing 'expert 0' brings it back to non-expert mode.

Here is a list of current commands:

1. resync (selectable)
    THUB    do nothing
    TCPU    3 0xe 0x2 0x0
            3 0xe 0x2 set-value
2. reset (selectable)
    THUB    4 0x81 0x3 0x81 0x0
    TCPU    child TDIG reset (5 0xe 0x2 0x1 0x2 0x0)

3. refresh (selectable)

4. user command 1: issue bunch reset to THUB NW

5. user command 2: reset all TDIGs (5 0xe 0x2 0x1 0x2 0x0)

You can clear crc errors by "user command 3" and bunch reset is issued at the end of commands sequence.

A2: You need to refresh; gathering CRC information from boards and updating display. 
I think the easiest and fastest way to do this is...
 1) Select "Error" in the left selector panel.
 2) Click "user command 3" to recover all error trays.
 3) Click top-left header button of the main panel to select all trays used to report errors
 4) Click "Refresh" button

Please note...
  1) you can unselect by clicking some part of gui like empty part under the left selector panel.
  2) User commands are not aware of the selection state of the main panel and do whatever defined in the database.

3) Refresh follows with recovery process 


Console commands:
